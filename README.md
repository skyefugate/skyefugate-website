## About This Site

This is my personal website, built using the amazing **Devolio** template created by [Alicia Sykes](https://aliciasykes.com).

**What it showcases:**
- Professional work experience and career progression
- Personal projects and open source contributions  
- Volunteer work and community involvement (SecKC leadership)
- Technical skills and expertise
- Contact information and social profiles

**Built with:**<br>
SvelteKit + TypeScript, prioritizing SEO, performance, accessibility, and compatibility.<br>
Data is fetched from external sources (GitHub, RSS, social platforms), so no CMS needed.

## Original Template Credit

This website is built on the incredible **[Devolio](https://github.com/Lissy93/devolio)** template by **[Alicia Sykes](https://aliciasykes.com)**.

Alicia created this masterpiece as a configurable, self-hosted developer portfolio that aggregates data from multiple sources. The template is open source and available for anyone to use - I highly recommend checking out her work!

- **Original Repository:** [Lissy93/devolio](https://github.com/Lissy93/devolio)
- **Creator:** [Alicia Sykes](https://aliciasykes.com)
- **License:** MIT

All credit for the core functionality, design patterns, and architecture goes to Alicia. I've simply customized it with my own content and made minor modifications to suit my needs.

<sub>A tutorial for building something similar is available on **[DEV.to](https://dev.to/lissy93/sveltekit-10-build-an-blog-fetching-posts-from-your-dev-profile-29f)**</sub>
